# Poker AI Flask App
I'm deciding to move from PyGame to Flask, because it is just a lot easier to have things responsive.

I am not the biggest fan of web, but I am realizing that websites make it easy for people
to interact with the things you make. I originally wrote the game in PyGame, but I realized
that it is not responsive, and if I want people to try it out, I just don't think it would 
look that good.

This is also a good opportunity to become better at making responsive sites?
