# Poker-AI
A small personal project that I want to work on this summmer. First focusing on heads-up poker. Later project will include 8-people in a table poker. 

Outline:
1. Create the Poker Environment
2. Create the AI
	- Plan is to explore different reinforcement learning algorithms, look into what papers have done
3. Profit $$

For now, I am trying to use `pygame` to render the game interactively.


Some Features that need to be implemented:
- Be able highlight the cards of the best hand, just like in a real poker game
