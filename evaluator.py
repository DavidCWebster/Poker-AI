# Uses Cactus Kevâ€™s 5-Card Evaluator: http://suffe.cool/poker/evaluator.html
# I am aware that this method is not the most efficient, I will look into implementations if needed

# https://www.codingthewheel.com/archives/poker-hand-evaluator-roundup

"""
# Some thoughts, the evaluator is sgoing to be important because it determines the rules
# of the game. However, we won't give our AI this. The environment will simply 
# feed the final reward, which is win or not win. 

# Reward = the amount of money you win or lose. 
# The optimal policy probably has to be probabilistic, actually no... maybe 
because the opponent will start figuring it out and calling / folding every time. 

Also, what kind of opponents do we want to be playing? 

Card representation also needs to be fast. Everything needs to be fast, for the AI
to run lots of simulations and figure out the optimal strategy. 

# I think I will consider two approaches
- Card Kev's which is a 5-card lookup table, will need to do lookup 21 times...
- Two + Two algorithm which is for a 7-card lookup table
https://github.com/chenosaurus/poker-evaluator/

Speed is pretty important, since I want to train the AI as fast as possible, so that it learns the optimal 
policy. If the game is slow, then there is no point.
